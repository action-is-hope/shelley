            Shelley is under no delusion that planting some trees will solve the
            ecological disaster that is currently unfolding. But it is a
            conversation starter and if we were talking about it every day with
            the seriousness it demands then do you think it would remain a
            problem for long? We must speak, really speak.
          </p>
          <p>Shelley is asking two things of you:</p>
          <ul>
            <Text as="li">Buy some trees</Text>
            <Text as="li">Have a real conversation about the climate.</Text>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At the end of that conversation you can decide on how many trees you
            would like plant.

        <P id="test">
          If you want to make websites then you're going to need a User
          Interface. ANd you're going to need to be willing to learn HTML and
          CSS properly. Not like these Boom, you've come to the right place.
          Lets show you around before we scare you off with 'installation
          'backend' devs that dismiss it as benerth them only to cock it up all
          the time. It will pay you back in spades..

        <p>
          Much like what is needed now in life we found we needed in tech. A
          simplier way.

        <p>
          Stylable's ethos in terms of providing an HTML styling API reminds us
          of the old skool Holy Grail days and CSS Zen garden. Showing our age a
          bit there aren't we! #peek-a-boo, I see you. You see what type of shit
          we had to deal with? You kids don't know you've been born...

          Millenials. Regulate mofos!
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading the spec is dull as! Happily you can learn most of what you
          need to know about HTML by learning about Accessibility, which is much
          more interesting because it is relatable to the physical realm. We can
          understand the 'why' of it all.

        <p>
          - The is a direct correlation between a developers 'ability' and their
          access to the internet. They look up a lot of stuff, on that large
          calculator we were told we would not have access to in school.
        </p>
        <p>
          - You won't have to learn a lot about web accessibility to know more
          than most that have worked on the web for years.

        <p>
          HEy devs, I know lots of you upgrade your machines and buy new ones
          and some of you end up with some machines lying around getting slower
          and less useful as time goes by... How about instead of selling it,
          you lend it to us so we can lend it to soemone with less privalage to
          learn. You can almost become like a mentor to them if yuo want, they
          will give you updates of where they are at. If you are happy with
          their progress maybe continiue to lend it to them... and agree that
          they will buy you a new machine when they can afford it from the cashj
          that they makle.

          What do we get? Dunno yet but it seems like there is merit to do
          something like this and where there is good to be done there is sually
          rewards too. The trick is to not look for them, wait for them to
          present themeselves. A better understanding of people outside of our
          circles. Different perspectives and cultures fusing. A better
          understanding of todays issues from a perspective we cannot really
          imagine even if we this we can. We will never be people of colour even
          though we feel most rooted in their company. People of colour have
          alwasy had to be 'progressive', the rest of us are now trying it out
          and realising that to be progressive is to be willing to rip apart
          everything you know. Our education, our the knowledage passed down,
          the books we have read, the news tghat we read social cameleon.

        <p>
          People of colour I need your help. I know I don't understand even
          though I try. Shit, 'try', rather a pathetic word to use in the
          context of understading racisum. To try suggests I accept failure as a
          possible outcome whihc allows it to fester with no due date.

        <p>
          Maybe I literally can't. I mean, sure I can go somewhere that they
          hate white people and experiance 'racisum' but no that's not rasicum
          at ALL. That's a loathing in response to something that my ancestors
          did or rather something that my bredrin still do. Exploit the
          vuneralble.

        <p>
          Where on thsi Earth can I go that I will experiance somebody thinking
          so little of me, my family, my people, my history that they deem
          themselves not superior but so superior, that they coul justify
          chaining me up with orders to tend their land. They would need to be
          so sure of this that they would be able to do this with a clean
          concise. land, if I am 'lucky' I will be the first to to sell my soul
          to become my masters sheep dog where I am forced to inflict pain on my
          bredrin. Where casn I go? All of this hatred would need to be based on

          Organise and do some live sessions for those those struggling to catch
          a break... Make it valuable to have been on it. Invite digital peeps
          from youth movements, XR etc etc.

          Too much calc? Maybe if every property had some crazy calc value based
          on viewport size then maybe things might get weird if resizing the
          browser... I've not the spare time to find out. I've seen some libs
          where they use a preprocessor to calculate at build time like (3 *
          $spacingUnit)px but I've yet to see many using calc instead calc(3 *
          $spacingUnit). Why would they if they can do it on build? Does that
          mean we shouldn't use them as live calcs?

          Calc has been around for donkies years, I mean even IE8 supports it.
          That is not true of many things in modern CSS yet alone something as
          powerful as calc. Only now do we see it really being used in
          mainstream CSS. This is likely down to the vh and vw additions which
          can be used in conjuntion with it.

          It probably doesn't bother other people as much but Shelley is a bit
          fussy and likes to points out that a paragraph is semantically nothing
          like a title so it's flawed.

          'Volume' is based on the idea that headings 'can be a bit shouty' and
          if headings can be shouty then perhaps we could use a tonal scale use
          such 'shout', 'speak' and 'whisper'.

        <p>Shelly said this was a bit 'novel', that's not good.</p>

        <p>
          So we agreed that we would just use a number scale. Shelley likes
          numbers, especially ones below 1.5&#8451; for some reason.

          Sometime we use grid for prototyping something, our grid should get it
          in the ball park and if we can't make it work then we start to cherry
          pick grid variables and apply them directly to our component.

          Google, Amazon serve at the highest level with a confidance that is
          hard to find with less CO2 in tensive providers. We should consider
          the offset they provide by enabling small outfits with big ideas get
          those ideas to market in a way that will allow them to scale to dizzy
          heights. The ultimate goal and if you can do it off the bat for cheap
          then they are enabling thousands. Of course they are also supplying
          serivices to those spereading mis-information. AI could surely help
          identify deciedful content? Of course AI could also be used to write
          mis-information very effectively. We are on the verge of a time where
          it will be easy to put together a totally fake video featuring an
          influential person. Even if they can be proven fake the damage has
          already been done.The jury has heard something they shouldn't have and
          that thing they hard was likely engineered with some Darren Brown
          shit. And who is going to confirm authenticity, enough money and
          payouts and you will make anything 'authentic' and then you just have
          yet another conspiricy theory. Think of Mary Shelley, a 19 year old
          living in 1800 who called it and encapsulated it in a workd that is
          beyound her years. We all need to be ready for this, this is tech that
          should have never been made. It will cast everything we know into
          doubt, it will be a fucking shit show. We need to demand better
          quality independing reporting. Like everything else we need to
          decentralise our media. It's already begun but paywalls are getting in
          the way of sharing content and it is damaging. There should be a
          service whihc allows users to access all sighed up sources to view
          paywall content. Like Netflix for news featuring peer reviewed news by
          independant journalists able to demonstrate their ability to remain
          neutral and deliver news in such a way that we have the information to
          make a reasonable accessment of what is going on. We should be able to
          link articles together so as to makle links
