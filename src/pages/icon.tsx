          Shelley borrows from the mighty Material UI here. We really like the
          ease of using their <code>SVGIcon</code> as it extends the base{" "}
          <code>svg</code> allowing us to use any old icon we find on the web by
          inserting the svg <code>path</code> as a child.

          An icon set is planned, it might be based on a simple roll of{" "}

          , an Open Source set that is fairly extensive. We do have some beef**
          with the &apos;accessibility&apos; icon denoting a wheelchair... but
          this is not an issue specific to this icon set. We shall see how we
          get on with it but may well fallback to the Material set.
        </P>

        <P>
          If you use an icon as a replacement for a text label be sure to use
          the <code>label</code> prop which will output a{" "}
          <code>VisuallyHidden</code> one for you, it&apos;s the law.

          Styling
        </H2>
        <P>
          Unlike some of our other components we do not use <code>vol</code>. In
          the example above you saw us using inline styles which is a no no for
          accessibility. Why? It is hard for users to override styles with their
          own so inline sizing and color is especially bad.
        </P>
        <P>
          We tend to apply these &apos;glue&apos; styles within our component
          compositions, or application components if you will.
        </P>
        <P>
          So at this level there isn&apos;t much to say on styling other than by
          default this is one of the few components that we so provide some
          default styles as part of the core.
        </P>
        <StyleInfo
          componentName={meta.name}

        <P>
          <strong>Note:</strong> In terms of text alternative we opted for
          visually hidden text over using titles within the <code>svg</code>{" "}
          itself or an <code>aria-label</code>. The icon is a non-focusable
          element so it might get ignored; in our experience this is{" "}
          <a href="https://simplyaccessible.com/article/7-solutions-svgs/">
            a reliable method for accessible SVG icons
          </a>{" "}
          so we continue to adopt it.

          This is the same checkpoint that we would use when auditing an image
          and as such the same rules apply, this is a{" "}

          . If you are using a visible label then an icon is classified as
          decorative, if you are not using a visible label then the image is
          functional and thus you should provide an equivalent.

          Of course you are likely to use icons in a multitude of places from
          input labels to buttons to definition lists. Just always be mindful
          when you are choosing icons, you might get what it means but will
          others? If you are in doubt; provide a visible label; otherwise
          provide the label as an alternative/equivalent via the{" "}
          <code>alt</code> prop.

          What about icon fonts?

          We don&apos;t like them and we don&apos;t recommend them as a
          professional solution, however are inventive; we like that about them
          - it&apos;s defo worth understanding how they work.
        </P>

        <H3 uppercase vol={2}>
          What is the problem?
        </H3>

        <P>
          They are not reliable enough, If you are working as part of any
          organisation that limits font downloads based on internal security
          restrictions, think UK public sector bodies, then they will not work
          and you will have wasted time trying to cut corners.

        <P>
          We speak from experience working within government sectors in the U.K.
          It will also trip you up if you have an international audience, the
          Great Firewall of China is known to interfere with such things. So
          unless you like presenting a load of empty boxes to your stakeholders
          then avoid using icon fonts.
        </P>

        <P>
          They are usually inserted via an <code>i</code> tag, this does not
          stand for <em>icon</em> but for <em>italic</em>. Lastly they will all
          be downloaded even if you only use five. As we said, they are
          inventive, from that perspective they are flawless.

          Can I use a SVG sprite instead?
        </H3>

        <P>
          Perhaps the most tempting reason to use icon fonts is the fact that
          you get access to all of them in one go with no need to import
          individual icons. Useful in a CMS if you are offering a number of icon
          options to your content authors.
        </P>

        <P>
          It is possible to do the same thing with inline SVG if you are happy
          to put a CSS sprite on the page. This can be convenient if you use the
          same icons a lot throughout an app.
        </P>

        <P>
          Maybe you can avoid the increased HTML payload of a SVG sprite by
          starting with an empty sprite injecting icons into it as a user
          progresses? Sounds fiddly and server side, well... Maybe use a sprite
          but try no to put a whole icon set in it if you only use 5 icons!
          Serve what they need.
