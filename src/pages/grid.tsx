          These days we are lucky to have a grid system baked into CSS via{" "}
          <code>display: grid;</code> so layout more about configuration rather
          selecting something in a grid framework. We find having a{" "}
          <code>Grid</code> component is useful for housing our core grid
          configs and their fallbacks as required.

          A simple foundation component like this paragraph can just sit quite
          happily in the <code>mid</code> section whilst an application
          component might need to span <code>edge-start / edge-end</code> and
          handle it&apos;s layout internally.

          Taking the image + caption below as an example, we have a{" "}

          as this paragraph. Nesting time!
        </P>

        <P>
          We insert the <code>figure</code> and assign it to <code>edge</code>.
          We then apply our main grid variant styles directly to it turning it
          into a nested mirror of its parent thus allowing us to position the

        <P>
          Getting back to the CSS, we thought it might be nice to do a little
          walkthrough of how we ended up where we did. Fairly rough notes:
        </P>

        <P>
          We started with a 12 col grid, as you do, and a known width{" "}
          <code>grid-gap</code> of <code>1rem</code> forming our <q>gutters</q>{" "}
          which has some fluidity because we have a responsive text scale on our{" "}
          <code>html</code> element... more on that later.
        </P>

        <CodeSample className={grid.mid}>{`.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-gap: 1rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
}`}</CodeSample>
        <P>
          To give us that container we added some <code>auto</code> columns to
          the outside but without limits on the internal column widths these
          will never engage and only give us a gutter width which maybe is ok
          for a mobile style.
        </P>

        <CodeSample
          className={grid.mid}
        >{`grid-template-columns: auto repeat(12, 1fr) auto;`}</CodeSample>

        <P>
          Now we have a 14 col grid, but you can consider the <code>auto</code>{" "}
          cols as your lock container with 12 columns inside of that, the actual
          playing surface.
        </P>

        <P>
          To make our <code>auto</code> columns chunkier we messed about with{" "}
          <code>minmax()</code> limiting the width of our internal columns thus
          distributing it to the autos.
        </P>

        <CodeSample
          className={grid.mid}
        >{`grid-template-columns: auto repeat(12, minmax(0, 4.6vw)) auto;`}</CodeSample>

        <P>
          Thinking ahead; we added some named grid lines so we could assign
          children to a variable like name over an index; as the viewport
          shrinks we can collapse the areas by moving some grid lines to the
          same line.
        </P>

        <P>
          This is where we decided to name the lines after typical areas found
          on a sports field. A few developers like sport... I think, maybe...
        </P>

        <P>Hmmm, well that looks ridiculous but it does work!</P>

        <P>
          We used something like this for a few weeks as we built out other
          things, moving the <code>mid</code> grid lines based on the viewport
          width via media queries in an attempt to maintain a good reading
          width.
        </P>

        <P>
          On reflection, chasing an optimal reading width across breakpoints by
          snapping the grid lines at different resolutions was crap, we needed a
          smaller amount of flex in the <code>mid</code> section. What could we
          do instead?
        </P>

        <P>
          We also noticed that when we used a nested grid as a container then
          the internal columns would have a width of zero inflating the autos
          blowing out everything on the parent. Do we even need the{" "}
          <code>minmax()</code> anymore?
        </P>

        <P>
          What if we get rid of the <code>minmax()</code> and maybe split{" "}
          <code>mid</code> into two columns and size them with our{" "}
          <code>rem</code> value is responsive?
        </P>

        <CodeSample
          className={grid.pen}
        >{`/* A lot shorter now which is nice. */
grid-template-columns: [edge-start] auto [goal-start] 4vw 4vw [pen-start] 4vw [mid-start] 11.75rem [half] 11.75rem [mid-end] 4vw [pen-end] 4vw 4vw [goal-end] auto [edge-end];`}</CodeSample>

        <P>
          As we did this we also changed our <code>grid-gap</code> opting for
          more fluidity via the <q>viewport width</q> unit <code>vw</code> to
          stop the contents becoming too wide leaving us with horizontal
          scrollies at narrower widths.
        </P>

        <P>
          So after some tweaks and messing about this is what we end up with for
          our grid, including breakpoints:

        <P>
          This change means we no longer are using a 12 column grid system!
          Maybe it will be too limiting in future? Ahhhh! It&apos;s ok, this is
          better for us, we&apos;re all about agile and what acutually works for
          us in the here and now based on what we know.
        </P>

        <P>
          We are not working to a design, just faffing about in the browser;
          when we are working with a static design we tend to use it as a
          guideline or a starting point. It serves to communicate the{" "}
          <q>vision</q> from where we can iterate in browser with{" "}
          <q>real feel</q>.
        </P>

        <P>
          When building to a fixed with design, you can start by aligning
          everything based on the visual but with fluid units. You should then
          do whatever works best in between your target breakpoints tweaking the
          fluid units as you see them in action.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you are not the designer then collaborate with them, demo and
          discuss the options, walk through them together and agree on the best
          outcome. Get your phones and ipads out, things always look different
          on device.

          Hacks with a fancy name but required if you are to support the
          annoying versions of IE that still pain us.
        </P>

        <P>
          Namely IE11 these days but also early versions of Edge on things like
          TV&apos;s at large clients offices that they like to do demos on
          catching you off guard. 😱
        </P>

        <P>
          We tend to support none-grid browsers but we don&apos;t want to spend
          too much time on them. As long as your main grid is solid then it
          shouldn&apos;t be too hard to float/hack some fallbacks in as and
          when.
        </P>

        <P>
          The <code>-ms-grid</code> implementation implements the old spec,
          perhaps we can use that? Errr, nope, not in this instance unless you
          fancy specifying the index of each row, no thanks. It&apos;s also
          IE11+ specific so is it really useful?
        </P>

        <P>
          Maybe we can just do something fairly simple for the main layout that
          isn&apos;t a proprietary Microsoft thang? I&apos;m pretty sure we can
          mimic our three main columns with some <code>max-width</code> and a

  max-width: value(fallbackMaxWidth);

Grid .mid {
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  max-width: value(fallbackMaxWidth);
}`}</CodeSample>

        <P>
          If you need to support older browsers and you use this bare in mind
          you essentially need a rule not to touch the left and right margins of
          grid items using these helper classes.
        </P>

        <P>
          To set top and bottom margins do so specifically, i.e{" "}
          <code>margin-top: 2rem;</code> over <code>margin: 2rem 0;</code> which
          of course would be setting them to <code>0</code>.
