          Labels are rather aptly <code>for</code> labelling things, form{" "}
          <code>input</code> tags specifically, <code>label</code> is one of the
          most important semantic tags to get right in terms of usability,
          accessibility and the law!

        <H2 vol={2} uppercase>
          Quick reference:
        </H2>
        <QuickRef />

        <P>
          Pretty useless by themselves, <code>labels</code> should generally be
          paired and associated with a form input. The most reliable way to do
          that is explicitly via the <code>for</code> and <code>id</code>{" "}
          attributes. In plain HTML:
        </P>

        <CodeSample
          className={grid.mid}
        >{`<label for="myTextField">Label text</Label>\n<input id="myTextField" type="text" placeholder="Focus people!"/>`}</CodeSample>
        {/*
          The for attribute is essentially a labels way of announcing to an 
          input that they are meant to be together. Awwww, they complete each other.
         */}

        <P>
          <strong>Note:</strong> In the React world we have to use{" "}
          <code>htmlFor</code> instead and you will definitely forget this at
          some point; I have no hair, #justSaying
        </P>

        <H2 vol={4} uppercase>
          Why Bother?
        </H2>

        <P>It makes them clickable, Yay!</P>

        <P>
          Click the label below, it <em>should</em> focus the text field giving
          us a larger &apos;hit&apos; area; useful on mobile devices.
        </P>

        <div className={classnames(grid.pen, utils.exampleBox)}>
          <InputText
            id="labelExampleId1"
            label={"Label text"}
            placeholder="We need some focus, up in here, up in here!"
            type="text"
            vol={3}
          />
        </div>

        <P>
          It may seem like a small thing but more importantly assistive
          technologies like screen readers use this relationship to properly
          announce form items. Without it people can be left fumbling around our
          poorly constructed forms.
        </P>

        <P>No excuses; this is basic HTML.</P>

        <H2 vol={4} uppercase>
          Usage
        </H2>

        <P>
          As you have seen, when we use <code>Label</code> in conjunction with
          text based inputs we usually render them adjacent to each other.
        </P>

        <P>
          Shelley chooses to render checkboxes, radios and switches{" "}
          <em>inside</em> of the labels so as to maximise the hit areas to
          include space in-between the two elements.
        </P>

        <P>
          To do this <em>we</em> use Shelley&apos;s{" "}
          <code>InputSelectionControl</code> component but you can use anything,
          just throw it inside via the <code>inputControl</code> prop.
        </P>

        <P>Let&apos;s have a poke around:</P>

        <ComponentDemo />

        <P>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Rendering an input inside does have the side
          effect of implicitly associating the elements but Shelley recommends
          always being explicit.
        </P>

        <P>
          If you do not know the ids of fields then always render them inside of
          labels but this should generally be avoided.
        </P>

        <H2 vol={4} uppercase>
          Styling
        </H2>

        <P>
          We are concerned with styling two main scenarios, one without an input
          and the other with.
        </P>

        <StyleInfo
          componentName={meta.name}
          componentHTML={<ComponentHTML />}
          componentCSS={<ComponentCSS />}
        />

        <P>
          Shelley&apos;s styles [link]are fairly light for this one, we set our
          positional stuff using <code>flex</code>, <code>weight</code> but not
          much else. We use it as a foundation so customise contextually based
          on use-case.
        </P>

        <P>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Labels are sometimes used erroneously in place
          of a <code>legand</code> tag so be sure that you are using the correct
          tag.
        </P>
