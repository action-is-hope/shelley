          Provides text for screen readers that is visually hidden so as to keep
          your design clean. Often referred to as <code>srOnly</code> elsewhere

        <P>
          Quite often in web design we find situations where context can be
          derived visually from the design of a page. Consider a typical
          &rsquo;See more&rsquo; link as an example.
        </P>
        <P>
          It&rsquo;s easy to scan the page and figure out where links go based
          on the surrounding text or imagary. But what if you cannot see the
          surrounding text or imagary?
        </P>
        <P>
          Well, in that case you might be using a screen reader. If that{" "}
          <em>is</em> the case; then you will likely be using a cool feature
          that allows you read out all links on a page. Cool huh?
        </P>
        <H2 vol={5}>Example: Crappy link text</H2>

          Lest take a look at a typical scenario on the web; a &rsquo;See

          Assuming the page is littered with this type of crappy link, which is

          Yep, this is a reality for a lot of people trying to navigate the web.

          When choosing link text or building webpages we need awareness and
          empathy when it comes to how others will interact with our creations.
          This is actually a legal requirement for most of us so do it! Unless
          you are the type of person that would refuse to install an access ramp
          to a building. Who does that? Not us!

            The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone
            or from the link text together with its programmatically determined
            link context, except where the purpose of the link would be
            ambiguous to users in general.

          FML. How many times did you have to read that? Me too! ;-) Yes, these
          do tend to be a little wordy and walk the line in terms of plain and
          simple language; especially if you consider beginners to web
          development and we must...
        </P>
        <P>
          The peeps over there do a great job; it&rsquo;s a tough task, we
          empathise with them. Ultimatley they are trying to make these things
          as exact as possible so as to remove ambiguity. This is essential for
          all implementers, from developers to browser vendors. Handy from a
          legal perspective too if you happen to be suing for non-compliance.
        </P>
        <P>
          So it is exact but it somehow misses the &rsquo;why&rsquo;. We should
          look for the &rsquo;why&rsquo;; accessibility then becomes less of a
          &rsquo;tick box&rsquo; exercise and more thought provoking. Lets have
          a go at rewriting it from the perspective of our glorious users!

            When reading out links by themsleves, I can get a good idea of where

            it&rsquo;s something like a game of &rsquo;snap&rsquo; where it

          If you are using a CMS then; for external links you can provide an
          extra field to capture the hidden text and for internal pages you can
          dynamically append the destination page title:

          doesn&rsquo;t work; it is admirable but unless you are educating
