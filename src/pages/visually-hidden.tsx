          Say hello to everyone and help them access content and features more
          easily. The little search bots will make better sense of it too,

        <P>
          &apos;Visually Hidden&apos; as a concept is often referred to as{" "}
          <code>
            <abbr title="Screen Reader Only">srOnly</abbr>
          </code>{" "}
          and should not be confused with <code>visibility: hidden</code> which
          will hide stuff from everybody. Visually <em>sounds</em> like
          visibility but it&apos;s not. Got it? Great, let&apos;s move on.
        </P>
        <H2 vol={4} uppercase>
          Why?
        </H2>
        <P>
          Quite often in web design we find situations where context can be
          derived visually from the layout / design of a page via the
          surrounding text and imagery.
        </P>
        <P>
          But what if you cannot see the surrounding text or imagery? Imagine
          you have lost all peripheral vision.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you struggle with low vision, you might be using a screen reader
          and a cool feature that allows you read out all links on a page.
          Pretty handy on the face of it right?
        </P>

        <H2 vol={3} uppercase>
          Example: See more
        </H2>
        <P>
          But wait. Let&apos;s take an imaginary screen reader for a spin.
          Consider a typical <em>see more...</em> link, like that you&apos;ve
          seen a hundred times, one that gives no meaningful context at all,
          just dots, three of them. How thoughtful.
        </P>

        <CodeSample className={grid.mid}>
          {`<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
<p>Nasa has a great resource for kids/adults all about climate change.</p>

        </CodeSample>
        <P>
          How does a page full of those bad boys sound on our screen reader?
        </P>
        <Blockquote variant={1} citeVol={2} cite="Shelley 'Reader'">
          <P vol={2}>

        </Blockquote>
        <P>
          Oh dear&hellip; so basically the opposite of making sense out of
          context, this makes <em>no</em> sense to screen readers or search
          bots.
        </P>
        <P>
          This is just one of many things that would likely <em>irritate</em>{" "}

          Fixing the problem
        </H3>
        <P>
          If we look at the link in isolation we can make a few changes and
          ensure that it is clear what is on the other end of it. Steps:
        </P>
        <ol>
          <Text tag="li">
            Hide the ... from assistive tech via <code>aria-hidden</code>, the
            logical opposite to <code>VisuallyHidden</code>. Handy.
          </Text>
          <Text tag="li">
            Define some text for the link itself to give it context and then
            hide it with <code>VisuallyHidden</code>. Done.
          </Text>
        </ol>

        <CodeSample className={grid.mid}>
          {`<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/climate-change-meaning/">
    See more<span aria-hidden>&hellip;</span>
    <VisuallyHidden>
      over at the Nasa climate kids website.

        </CodeSample>

        <P>
          With the changes in place our screen reader will announce the entire
          link whilst sighted users will simply see &apos;See more&hellip;&apos;

        <P>Maybe things aren&apos;t so easy in a CMS?</P>

        <P>
          When choosing link text or building web pages we need awareness and
          empathy when it comes to how others will interact with our creations.
          This is actually a legal requirement for most of us too!

            The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone
            or from the link text together with its programmatically determined
            link context, except where the purpose of the link would be
            ambiguous to users in general.

          FML. How many times did you have to read that? Me too! ;-) Yes, these

          The peeps over there do a great job; it&apos;s a tough task, we
          empathise with them. Ultimately they are trying to make these things
          as exact as possible so as to remove ambiguity. This is essential for
          all implementers, from developers to browser vendors. Handy from a
          legal perspective too if you happen to be holding orgs to account.
        </P>
        <P>
          It is exact, but it somehow misses the &apos;why&apos;. We should
          always look for the &apos;why&apos;; accessibility then becomes less
          of a &apos;tick box&apos; exercise and more thought provoking. Lets
          have a go at rewriting it from the perspective of our glorious users!

            When reading out links by themselves, I can get a good idea of where

          If you are using a CMS then; for external links you can provide an
          extra field to capture the hidden text and for internal pages you can
          dynamically append the destination page title:
