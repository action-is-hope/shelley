          Provides text for screen readers that is visually hidden so as to keep
          your design clean. Often referred to as <code>srOnly</code> elsewhere

        <H2 vol={6}>What is it for?</H2>

        <P>
          Quite often in web design we find situations where context can be
          derived visually from the design of a page. Consider a typical
          &rsquo;See more&rsquo; link as an example.
        </P>

        <P>
          It&rsquo;s easy to scan the page and figure out where links go based
          on the surrounding text or imagary. But what if you cannot see the
          surrounding text or imagary?
        </P>

        <P>
          Well, in that case you might be using a screen reader. If that{" "}
          <em>is</em> the case; then you will likely be using a cool feature
          that allows you read out all links on a page. Cool huh?
        </P>

        <H2 vol={5}>Example: Crappy link text</H2>

        <P>
          Lest take a look at a typical scenario on the web; a &rsquo;See
          more&rsquo; link without any context.
        </P>

        <CodeSample>
          {`<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
<p>Nasa has a great resource for kids/adults all about climate change.</p>

</p>`}
        </CodeSample>

        <P>
          Assuming the page is littered with this type of crappy link, which is
          usually the case, how does it read if we are using a screen reader?
        </P>

        <Blockquote variant={2}>
          <P>See more... See more... See more... See more... See more...</P>

        <P>
          Ahhh, crap! That&rsquo;s about as useful as expanding the worlds
          airports in the wake of a climate emergency.
        </P>

        <P>
          Yep, stupid crap like that is a reality for a lot of people trying to
          navigate the interwebs. It is one of many things that will likley piss
          them off when using websites that do not adhere to the Web Content
          Accessibiliy Guidelines (WCAG), which covers this type of stuff.
        </P>

        <H3 vol={4}>Fixing the problem</H3>

        <P>
          In the following example, screen readers will announce the entire link
          even though sighted users will simply see &rsquo;See more&rsquo; as{" "}
          <del>God intended</del>, I mean as your <ins>designer requested</ins>.

          When choosing link text or building webpages we need awareness and
          empathy when it comes to how others will interact with our creations.
          This is actually a legal requirement for most of us so do it! Unless
          you are the type of person that would refuse to install an access ramp
          to a building. Who does that? Not us!

            or from the link text together with its programmatically determined
