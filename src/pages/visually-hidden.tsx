          Say hello to those people and help them more easily use features and

          Often referred to as <code>srOnly</code> elsewhere on the web and not
          to be confused with <code>visibility: hidden</code> which will hide it
          from everybody. Visually is different from visibility but we get
          muddled up sometimes.
        </P>
        <H2 vol={4} uppercase>
          Why?
        </H2>
        <P>
          Quite often in web design we find situations where context can be
          derived visually from the layout / design of a page via the
          surrounding text and imagary.
        </P>
        <P>
          But what if you cannot see the surrounding text or imagary? Imagine
          you have lost all peripheral vision.
        </P>
        <P>
          If you struggle with low vision you might be using a screen reader and
          a cool feature that allows you read out all links on a page. Pretty
          handy on the face of it right?
        </P>

        {/* We have no peripheral vision whatsoever. */}
        <H2 vol={2} uppercase>
          Example: See more
        </H2>
        <P>
          But wait. Lets take an imaginary screen reader for a spin. Consider a
          typical <em>see more...</em> link, like that you&apos;ve seen a
          hundred times, one that gives gives no meaningful context at all, just
          dots, three of them. How thoughtful.
          {/* Lest take a look at a typical scenario on the web; a &rsquo;See

          Fixing the problem
        </H3>
        <P>
          If we look at the link in isolation we can make a few changes and
          ensure that it is clear what is on the other end of it. Steps:
        </P>
        <ol>
          <Text as="li">
            Hide the ... from assistive tech via <code>aria-hidden</code>, the
            logical opposite to <code>VisuallyHidden</code>. Handy.
          </Text>
          <Text as="li">
            Define some text for the link itself to give it context and then
            hide it with <code>VisuallyHidden</code>. Done.
          </Text>
        </ol>

        <CodeSample>
          {`<a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/climate-change-meaning/">
    See more<span aria-hidden>&hellip;</span>
    <VisuallyHidden>
      over at the Nasa climate kids website.
    </VisuallyHidden>
  </a>`}
        </CodeSample>

        <P>
          Witht the changes in place our screen reader will announce the entire

        <P>
          When choosing link text or building webpages we need awareness and
          empathy when it comes to how others will interact with our creations.
          This is actually a legal requirement for most of us too!

            The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone
            or from the link text together with its programmatically determined
            link context, except where the purpose of the link would be
            ambiguous to users in general.

          FML. How many times did you have to read that? Me too! ;-) Yes, these

        <P>
          The peeps over there do a great job; it&rsquo;s a tough task, we
          empathise with them. Ultimatley they are trying to make these things
          as exact as possible so as to remove ambiguity. This is essential for
          all implementers, from developers to browser vendors. Handy from a
          legal perspective too if you happen to be suing for non-compliance.
        </P>
        <P>
          So it is exact but it somehow misses the &rsquo;why&rsquo;. We should
          look for the &rsquo;why&rsquo;; accessibility then becomes less of a
          &rsquo;tick box&rsquo; exercise and more thought provoking. Lets have
          a go at rewriting it from the perspective of our glorious users!

          If you are using a CMS then; for external links you can provide an
          extra field to capture the hidden text and for internal pages you can
