              We strive to excite and enable the passionate, experienced or
              otherwise. We&apos;ve positioned this site to serve as a general
              resource for those that seek knowledge in terms of practical HTML,
              CSS and accessibility. JavaScript or any other language churning
              out HTML is simply a facilitator.
            </P>

            <P>
              This site (link code on Github) is also a living example of
              Shelley in use with the wonderful Gatsby which is a great
              companion when starting out with React.

              Each component page first describes the React side of things; then
              we talk about the actual HTML churned out by the component and the
              selectors you have to style it.

            <P>
              We are also quite prone to comments so do look through our code
              base, especially our theme when we &apos;finish&apos; it.

              A desirable goal of this project would be, in the spirit of Zen to
              set up a repo for Shelley themes. We hope we get to it fairly soon

            <P>
              We found Shelley, a slightly bitter and exacting digital entity,
              moping around the internet looking rather rejected and
              misunderstood but poised with imagination and spirit.
            </P>

            <P>
              We made a pact to take all of our anger, bitterness, fear, sorrow
              and general doom with regards to the state of our planetary ship;
              channel it and join the guardians defending her from infinite
              consumption, those imagining and implementing creative solutions
              whilst inspiring past the cynicism to see that we can do better,
              we can live better.
            </P>

            <P>
              What else are we suppose to do? It&apos;s the only ship we have
              and we are quite fond of her and <em>all</em> of her inhabitants.

            <P>
              Current focus: Shelley exists mainly as a technical enabler for us

            <P>
