            <P>
              We found Shelley, a slightly bitter and exacting digital entity,
              moping around the internet looking rather rejected and
              misunderstood but poised with imagination and spirit.

              We made a pact to take all of our bewildering emotion with regards

              defending her from the barage of infinite consumption.
            </P>

            <P>
              We pledge to demonsrate thoughtfulness in emotional times, we seek
              to faciliate those imagining and implementing creative solutions
              whilst inspiring past cynicism.
            </P>

              We are not quite sure what else <em>to</em> do. <em>This be</em>{" "}
