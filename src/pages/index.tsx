            This site is build with Shelley and hopefully will be a useful
            referancre for you. We have tried to be as chatty as possible in our
            CSS files. Wix promote the idea that we should perhaps comment each
            line of CSS indicating it's purpose. This may sound crazy but it
            really helps newcomers to the code base as well as your own
            knowledge in terms of what is happening. It's easy in CSS to hack
            around until stuff works and then leave it. Commenting each line
            forces a deeper understanding.

            We found Shelley, a slightly bitter and exacting digital entity,

            but poised with imagination and spirit.

            Shelley however says that she didn't sit there trapped within the
            fibres of a secret edition of Frankenstein. The manuscript cursed
            with the same sort of sourcery of that of Dorians painting only to
            be told that she must accept that humanity will never have heided
            her warning of mans creation long ago. The devil is within.

            Shelley is under no delusion that planting some trees will solve the
            ecological disaster that is currently unfolding. But it is a
            conversation starter and if we were talking about it every day with
            the seriousness it demands then do you think it would remain a
            problem for long? We must speak, really speak.

            At the end of that conversation you can decide on how many trees you
