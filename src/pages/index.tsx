              This is a style library for React but this website also serves as
              a resource who want to know more about HTML, CSS and accessibility
              in general and see some relatable examples in the flesh.
            </P>

            <P>
              Each component page first describes the React side of things, with
              a demo; then we talk about the actual HTML that the component
              churns out and the CSS selectors you have to style it.
            </P>

            <P>
              We also throw in some links to our this sites CSS which you are
              free to use, customise and learn from AND you get to feel a bit
              better about your impact on the world buy buying a tree or
              starting your own forest.

              Shelley would not be possible without Stylable, a style managing
              solution built by a great team over at Wix who describe it as:{" "}

            </P>

            <P>
              Stylable reunites us with our inner Zen Garden &apos;skillz&apos;
              with a wonderful feeling of nostalgia with its simple and
              standards aware approach to managing styles.
