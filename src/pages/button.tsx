          Let&apos;s take a look at a few variations, there are a load of
          permutations but you will likely end up using only a few as defined by
          your design system.
        </P>

        <ComponentDemo />

        <P>
          As ever, if this component isn&apos;t really working for you then you
          can make your own, clone ours for a starting point if you need a
          legup. It&apos;s pretty simple, we like simple.

          Styling
        </H2>

        <P>
          In terms of HTML structure, we have a button and an inner button. The
          inner button is pretty key if we are to throw in other things like
          icons inside. We put out vertical alignment on the inner item so as to
          allow an adjacent icon to span the full height.
        </P>

        <P>
          When providing state styles for things like loading or pressed then we
          suggest you use the aria attributes and target the attribute states.

          It&apos;s a <code>button</code>, use it, don&apos;t use a{" "}
          <code>div</code> styled to look like a button, just use a button. Make
          sure it has good focus styles and make sure that it does what it
          should when you test it with the keyboard.
        </P>

        <P>
          If you are throwing an <code>Icon</code> inside with no visible text
          label then be sure to provide one via the <code>alt</code> prop on the
          icon which mirrors that of an image.
        </P>

        <P>
          Use them sensibly to ensure that your interface is{" "}

          <code>onKeydown</code> or anything weird, <em>use</em> buttons.
