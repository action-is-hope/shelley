        <P>
          Shelley uses a volume property, <code>vol</code> for the general
          sizing of components. Text accepts <code>{`vol={1-12}`}</code> as well
          as an option to turn it off, <code>{`vol={false}`}</code>. Simples.
        </P>

        <P>
          Using <code>{`vol={false}`}</code> is useful when we need all of the
          text styling apart from font-sizing, which is to be defined via custom
          class or by styling it as an named import inside of another component.

          Text usually accounts for large proportion of a website / application

          Shelley allows you to do whatever you want in terms of styling via
          pre-definded style hooks. You can of course add your own style
          variants by adding additional CSS class selectors within your{" "}

        <P>
          Check the preview below to see our scale looks like at the moment. The
          fact that the text scales without snapping is great as it really
          allows us to relax in the knowledge that the text will always be
          relatively similar in terms of the space used across all device
          widths. Phew!

          All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and

          contains about 97% of the Earthâ€™s water.
        </P>
        <P>
          The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system. Around
          10% of Earthâ€™s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The
          ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected
          with other components of the climate system through global exchange of
          water, energy and carbon.
        </P>

          The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and
          current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global
          warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia
          that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and
