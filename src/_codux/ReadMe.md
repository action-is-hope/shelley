# Codux

Codux is a project developed by the team at Wix that allows one to visually edit projects side-by-side with your code editor. It is in Beta but we are playing around with it as it has great potential to bridge the gap between developers and designers but more than that it looks to be a great tool for developers to navigate and edit components with instant visual feedback.
