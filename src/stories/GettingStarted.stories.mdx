# Getting started

Shelley uses Stylable and as such you will need to get your project working with Stylable.

## New project

You can quickly start a new Stylable project using the [create stylable app]()
There are currently two ways of starting working with Stylable:

- Quickly start a new project from a [boilerplate](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/boilerplate)
- Integrate into a new or existing project by [manually configuring](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/manual-integration) Stylable.

Optionally (highly recommended), you can install [Stylable Intelligence](https://stylable.io/docs/getting-started/tooling/stylable-intelligence), an extension providing IDE support for code completion and diagnostics (currently supported only for Visual Studio Code).
