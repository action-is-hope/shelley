Toast is used for displaying a short message to the user. It is a non-modal, time-based notification that appears in the bottom right corner or bottom center of the screen. Toasts are used to provide feedback on an action that the user has taken, such as saving a file or sending a message.

## Example

This example displays a toast.

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="a) Toast success"
    args={{ type: "success" }}
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: dedent`
<Toast type="success">
  
</Toast>`,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    <ToastSuccess />
  </Story>
</Preview>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-tabs--a-basic-tabs" />
