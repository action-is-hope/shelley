# Disclosures

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    import { Disclosure, DisclosureGroup } from "@actionishope/shelley/Disclosure";
  `}
/>

A Disclosure component allows users to toggle the visibility of additional content by clicking on a title or trigger. It offers a convenient way to expand or collapse sections of information, providing a more organised and user-friendly presentation of content.

## Disclosure

Disclosure can be used directly or indirectly via DiaclosureGroup, the example below demonstrates a single Disclosure with the icon position set to `start`.

<Story
  name="a) Disclosure"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
<Disclosure
  title="Single Disclosure"
  triggerProps={{ iconPos: "start", vol: 5 }}
>
  <>
    <H2 vol={3}>Disclosure title</H2>
    <P vol={2}>Some content inside of the Disclosure.</P>
  </>
</Disclosure>`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {SingleDisclosure.bind({})}
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--a-disclosure" />

We are leveraging the `triggerProps` here which allows you to use any of the visual props associated with the Button component (Disclosure uses Button for the Trigger). All of the visual props are set to `false` by default so you can choose to apply your own styling via a `className` that `st-extends` Disclosure. You could of course target the button `variant` inside a Disclosure to tweak it for this use-case but if it detracts wildly from the look of your button variants then consider using a `className` instead.

**Note:** `iconPos` can be provided directly or as part of the `triggerProps` (as above) where it will take precedence.

### Accessibility

The `Disclosure` component is designed with accessibility in mind. It uses semantic
HTML elements and applies appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure screen readers and
assistive technologies can properly interpret and interact with the disclosure items.

Make sure to provide meaningful and descriptive titles for each disclosure item to
aid users who rely on assistive technologies.

### Expanded

Setting a Disclosure to be expanded can be done by using the `defaultExpanded` (uncontrolled) or `isExpanded` (controlled) prop.

<Story
  name="b) Expanded"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(true);\n
return (
  <>
    <Disclosure title="Single Disclosure (uncontrolled)" defaultExpanded>
      <P vol={2}>Uncontrolled Disclosure content.</P>
    </Disclosure>\n
    <Disclosure
      title="Single Disclosure (controlled)"
      isExpanded={isExpanded}
      onExpandedChange={() => setIsExpanded((v) => !v)}
    >
      <P vol={2}>Controlled Disclosure content.</P>
    </Disclosure>
  </>
);
`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {SingleDisclosureExpanded.bind({})}
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--b-expanded" />

### Custom Icon

It is possible to override the default icon but it must be wrapped in an Icon component in order for it to work properly.

<Story
  name="c) Trigger Icon"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
import { Icon, IconProps } from "@actionishope/shelley/Icon";\n
const CustomIcon: React.VFC<IconProps> = () => (
  /* This is a Material UI icon so we set the viewBox accordingly. */
  <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d="m20 12-1.41-1.41L13 16.17V4h-2v12.17l-5.58-5.59L4 12l8 8 8-8z"></path>
  </Icon>
);\n
<Disclosure
  title="Single Disclosure"
  triggerIcon={CustomIcon}
  iconPos="end"
>
  <>
    <H2 vol={3}>Disclosure title</H2>
    <P vol={2}>Some content inside of the Disclosure.</P>
  </>
</Disclosure>
`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {SingleDisclosureCustomIcon.bind({})}
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--c-trigger-icon" />

### Icon alt text

The alternative text for the icon can be overridden via `expandedString` and `collapseString` and you can make the alt text visible via the `iconAltVisible` if your audience needs the assist.

<Story
  name="d) Icon alt text"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
<Disclosure
  title="Single Disclosure"
  expandString="Show more"
  collapseString="Show less"
  iconAltVisible
>
  <>
    <H2 vol={3}>Disclosure title</H2>
    <P vol={2}>Some content inside of the Disclosure.</P>
  </>
</Disclosure>`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  {SingleDisclosureIconAlt.bind({})}
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--d-icon-alt-text" />

### Internationalistion

Ensure to set the expand and collapse strings dependant on the language you are currently serving.

### Disclosure Props

<ArgsTable of={DisclosurePropsTable} />

## Disclosure Group

Whilst you can stack Disclosure's together to display a dynamic collection of Disclosure's you can use a DisclosureGroup and the `items` prop.

### Dynamic items

<Story
  name="e) DisclosureGroup"
  args={{}}
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
const items = [
  {
    id: "item1",
    title: "Item 1",
    content: "This is the content of item 1.",
    related: "Related content",
  },
  {
    id: "item2",
    title: "Item 2",
    content: "This is the content of item 2.",
    related: "Related content",
  },
];\n
return (
  <DisclosureGroup items={items} triggerProps={{ vol: 4 }}>
    {(item) => (
      <>
        <P vol={2}>{item.content}</P>
        {item?.related && (
          <P vol={2} className={spacing.mt1}>
            <strong>See also:</strong> {item.related}
          </P>
        )}
      </>
    )}
  </DisclosureGroup>
);`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <DynamicDisclosureGroup />
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--e-disclosure-group" />

If items have a children prop you do not need to explicitly render it as above (you still can if you need).

<Story
  name="e) Items with Children"
  args={{}}
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
const items = [
  {
    id: "item1",
    title: "Item 1",
    children: <p>This is the content of item 1.</p>,
  },
  {
    id: "item2",
    title: "Item 2",
    children: <p>This is the content of item 2.</p>,
  },
];\n
return (
  <DisclosureGroup items={items}" />
);`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <DynamicDisclosureGroupChildren />
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--e-items-with-children" />

### Single view

To only have one item open at any one time you can use the `singleView` prop.

<Story
  name="f) Single View"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
<DisclosureGroup items={items}" singleView />`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <DisclosureGroupSingleView />
</Story>

<Source language="tsx" id="data-disclosures--f-single-view" />

### Testing

You can use the `"data-id"` prop to add custom data attributes to the `DisclosureGroup` component and its child elements.
This can be helpful for selecting and interacting with the component during testing.
The value of `"data-id"` is appended with specific identifiers to create unique data attribute values for each element within the component.

### DisclosureGroup Props

<ArgsTable of={DisclosureGroup} />

### Styling

To style the `DisclosureGroup` component, you can pass a `className` prop with additional CSS classes to the
component. The root `<div>` element of the component will have these classes applied,
allowing you to customize the appearance of the disclosure group.

Additionally, you can target the individual elements within the `DisclosureGroup`
component using CSS selectors and styling rules based on their class names.
The specific class names used in the component's rendering can be found in the code,
such as `classes.root`, `classes.disclosure`,
`classes.trigger`, `classes.title`, `classes.transition`, and `classes.content`.
