# DisclosureGroup Component

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    import { DisclosureGroup } from "@actionishope/shelley";
  `}
/>

Disclosures are used to show and hide content. They are useful for showing and
hiding content that is not immediately relevant to the user.
The `DisclosureGroup` component is a React component that displays a collection of disclosure items.
Each disclosure item can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its content.
This component is useful for creating collapsible sections or accordion-style interfaces.

## Example

This example displays a disclosure group with an optional title and a list of items.
Items are passed as an array of objects with a title and items property.

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Disclosure Group"
    args={{}}
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: dedent`
            <DisclosureGroup
              title="Disclosure Group"
              items={items}"
            />`,
        },
      },
    }}

### Example Usage

```jsx
<DisclosureGroup
  title="Disclosure Group"
  className="my-disclosure-group"
  items={[
    {
      id: "item1",
      title: "Item 1",
      children: <p>This is the content of item 1.</p>,
    },
    {
      id: "item2",
      title: "Item 2",
      children: <p>This is the content of item 2.</p>,
    },
  ]}
  data-id="my-disclosure-group"
/>
```

### How it Works

The `DisclosureGroup` component renders a `<div>` element as the root container for
the disclosure group. It applies CSS classes to the root element and attaches the
custom data-id attribute if provided.

Inside the root `<div>`, an `<ul>` element is rendered with a CSS class indicating that
it represents an accordion-style interface. The `items` array is mapped over to render
each individual disclosure item as an `<li>` element within the `<ul>`.
Each disclosure item is wrapped in a `Disclosure` component.

The `Disclosure` component handles the state and behavior of each disclosure item.
It consists of a trigger element (button) and the hidden content that gets
revealed when the trigger is activated. The `Disclosure` component receives the `id`,
`title`, and `children` from each item in the `items` array.

The `Disclosure` component is responsible for managing the disclosure state using the `useDisclosure`
custom hook. It initializes the state variables for `isExpanded` (whether the disclosure item
is expanded or collapsed) and `height` (the height of the hidden content).

The `useDisclosure` hook provides the necessary props and state variables for the `Disclosure`
component. It sets up event listeners for resizing the window and toggling the disclosure item.
It also calculates the height of the hidden content and manages the accessibility
attributes of the disclosure item.

The disclosure item's trigger element is rendered as a `<Button>` component, which receives
props such as `onClick`, `onKeyDown`, and `data-id`. The trigger element is responsible
for toggling the disclosure state when activated.

The hidden content is rendered within a `<Text>` component, which handles the accessibility
attributes and styling of the hidden content. The content is initially hidden and its height
is set dynamically based on the `isExpanded` state.

### Accessibility

The `DisclosureGroup` component is designed with accessibility in mind. It uses semantic
HTML elements and applies appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure screen readers and
assistive technologies can properly interpret and interact with the disclosure items.

Each disclosure item's trigger element (button) has `aria-expanded` and
`aria-controls` attributes that indicate the expanded/collapsed state and the corresponding
hidden content element. The hidden content element has `aria-hidden` and `aria-labelledby`
attributes to convey its visibility and association with the trigger element.

Make sure to provide meaningful and descriptive titles for each disclosure item to
aid users who rely on assistive technologies.

### Testing

You can use the `"data-id"` prop to add custom data attributes to the `DisclosureGroup` component and its child elements.
This can be helpful for selecting and interacting with the component during testing.
The value of `"data-id"` is appended with specific identifiers to create unique data attribute values for each element within the component.

For example, if you set `data-id="my-disclosure-group"`, the root `<div>` element will
have `data-id="my-disclosure-group"`,
the `<ul>` element will have `data-id="my-disclosure-group--accordion"`, and so on.
This allows you to target specific elements during testing by their data attributes.

Ensure that you have appropriate testing frameworks and libraries set up in your project
to write tests for the `DisclosureGroup` component and verify its behavior and rendering.

That covers the detailed documentation for the `DisclosureGroup` component, including its usage,
behavior, styling, accessibility considerations, and testing recommendations.
Feel free to adapt and expand upon this documentation based on your project's specific
requirements and guidelines.

### DisclosureGroup Props

<ArgsTable of={DisclosureGroup} />

The `DisclosureGroup` component accepts the following props:

- `className` (string, optional): Additional CSS class name(s) to be applied to the root `<div>` element of the component.
- `items` (array of DisclosureProps): An array of objects representing the individual
  disclosure items to be rendered within the group.
- `"data-id"` (string, optional): A custom data attribute to be added to the root `<div>`
  element and all child elements within the component. This can be used for testing or other custom purposes.

### Disclosure Props

Each object in the `items` array represents a disclosure item and should have the following properties:

- `id` (string): A unique identifier for the disclosure item.
- `title` (string): The title or heading of the disclosure item.
- `children` (ReactNode): The content to be displayed when the disclosure item is expanded.

### Styling

To style the `DisclosureGroup` component, you can pass a `className` prop with additional CSS classes to the
component. The root `<div>` element of the component will have these classes applied,
allowing you to customize the appearance of the disclosure group.

Additionally, you can target the individual elements within the `DisclosureGroup`
component using CSS selectors and styling rules based on their class names.
The specific class names used in the component's rendering can be found in the code,
such as `classes.root`, `classes.accordion`, `classes.accordionItem`, `classes.disclosure`,
`classes.trigger`, `classes.title`, `classes.hiddenContent`, and `classes.content`.
