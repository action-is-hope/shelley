Disclosures are used to show and hide content. They are useful for showing and
hiding content that is not immediately relevant to the user.

## Example

This example displays a disclosure group with an optional title and a list of items.
Items are passed as an array of objects with a title and content property.

<Preview>
  <Story
    name="Disclosure Group"
    args={{}}
    parameters={{
      docs: {
        source: {
          code: dedent`
            <DisclosureGroup
              title="Disclosure Group"
              items={items}"
            />`,
        },
      },
    }}
  >
    <DynamicDisclosureGroup />
  </Story>
</Preview>
