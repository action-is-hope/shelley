# Blockquote

Blockquotes are used for quoting; they tell any tech listening that this is a reference to someone else's words. A screen reader might announce or emphasise blockquote text whilst a search bot _might_ consider it relevant when assigning value to a page.

They should only be used semantically, i.e. don't just use them just for 'visual effect'.

See Smashing Magazine 2008 - [Block Quotes and Pull Quotes: Examples and Good Practices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/06/block-quotes-and-pull-quotes-examples-and-good-practices/); the designs might be outdated but the semantic info and advise on usage still applies.

## Blockquote Props

While there is no “pull quote” element, the latest iteration of the html spec encourages use of the Aside element.
