# Tabs

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    import { Tabs } from "@actionishope/shelley";
  `}
/>

Provides the behavior and accessibility implementation for a tab list. Tabs organize content into multiple sections and allow users to navigate between them.

Tabs provide a list of tabs that a user can select from to switch between multiple tab panels. useTabList, useTab, and useTabPanel can be used to implement these in an accessible way.

- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions on tabs
- Support for LTR and RTL keyboard navigation
- Support for disabled tabs
- Follows the tabs ARIA pattern, semantically linking tabs and their associated tab panels
- Focus management for tab panels without any focusable children

Tabs consist of a tab list with one or more visually separated tabs. Each tab has associated content, and only the selected tab's content is shown. Each tab can be clicked, tapped, or navigated to via arrow keys. Depending on the keyboardActivation prop, the tab can be selected by receiving keyboard focus, or it can be selected with the Enter key.

Keyboard Activation

By default, pressing the arrow keys while focus is on a Tab will switch selection to the adjacent Tab in that direction, updating the content displayed accordingly.

# Usage

This example displays a basic list of tabs. The currently selected tab receives a tabIndex of 0 while the rest are set to -1 ensuring that the whole tablist is a single tab stop. The selected tab has a different style so it's obvious which one is currently selected. useTab and useTabPanel handle associating the tabs and tab panels for assistive technology. The currently selected tab panel is rendered below the list of tabs.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    <Tabs aria-label="Tabs aria label description">
      <Item title="Tab title 1">Tab description 1</Item>
      <Item title="Tab title 2">Tab description 2</Item>
      <Item title="Tab title 3">Tab description 3</Item>
    </Tabs>
  `}
/>

## Dynamic Tabs

This example displays a dynamically created basic list of tabs.

<Preview>
  <Story name="b) Dynamic Tabs" args={{}}>
    {DynamicTabs.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Disabled

All tabs can be disabled using the isDisabled prop.

<Preview>
  <Story name="c) Disabled Tabs" args={{}}>
    {DisabledTabs.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Orientation

By default, tabs are horizontally oriented. The orientation prop can be set to vertical to change this. This affects keyboard navigation.

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    <Tabs orientation="vertical">
      <Item title="Tab title 1">Tab description 1</Item>
      <Item title="Tab title 2">Tab description 2</Item>
      <Item title="Tab title 3">Tab description 3</Item>
    </Tabs>
  `}
/>

<Preview>
  <Story name="d) Vertical Tabs" args={{}}>
    {VerticlalTabs.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Preview>
