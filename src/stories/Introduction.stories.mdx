# Shelley

Shelley is an accessible _headless_ (unstyled by default) UI library for React and is built primarily upon [Adobe React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) and [Adobe React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/index.html) allowing you to implement your own design system quickly and with confidence.

For styling Shelley implements [Wix's Stylable](https://stylable.io/), huge props to the team over at Wix Engineering for giving us CSS back with a bang!

## Adobe React Aria & React Stately

The folks over at Adobe have been busy building their React component library which adhers to the [Adobe design system, Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/). Whilst that's cool if you are wanting to follow that design system, it is less useful if you do not.

Happily these lovely people decided to seperate out most of the [behavior](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/interactions.html), [accessibility](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/accessibility.html), and [internationalisation](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/internationalization.html) support and provide it for free mainly in the form of hooks.

For us this was a no-brainer becuase this stuff is _hard_ and these packages allow us to focus on building out the styles defined by our design systems, whatever they may be with Stylable.

## Stylable

[Stylable](https://stylable.io/) is a modern CSS pre-processor built for components. Each component exposes a style API that maps its internal parts so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability.

Developed by [Wix Engineering](https://www.wix.engineering/) alongside the original 'web standards lovegod' [Bruce Lawson](https://brucelawson.co.uk/2018/the-making-of-stylable-the-musical/) it is simple, managable, performant and standards based whilst also giving CSS a _type system_ doing for CSS what Typescript has done for Javascript.

We would recommend that you take some time looking through the [Stylable handbook](https://stylable.io/docs/guides/handbook/intro) to get more of a feel for what the super talented team at Wix have built.
