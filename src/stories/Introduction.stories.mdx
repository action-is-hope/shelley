# Shelley

Shelley is an _unstyled first_ UI library, meaning that it ships with a very minimal set of styles givin you complete control of your styling strategy.

That doesn't mean we don't have a base theme for you to start with, it just means that you have complete control over your styles and how they are put together. If you are a fan of CSS and like/need to control the CSS used in your project then Shelley might be for you. if this idea repulses you then maybe for for something more like Material UI which actually does have an unstyled option these days.

## Styling

First question is a bit of an edge case but are you planning to build multiple sites with one set of HTML with multiple themes?

If no then you can use the props throughout your markup to define the types of buttons and text you would like as you are working to just one design.

If yes then you might set yourself up with a load of mixins and point to them instead. Think: What the design changes between theme? I.E Component A with design A has a CTA of type "primary" but Component A with design B has a cta type of "secondary". Now you would be in the position that you need to override a primary button to look like a secondary button just for that component. By turning the look and feel props off you get a raw button and you can then apply classes to your component A button which in turn can point to a mixin of primary. This way you can granula control over the styles applied to buttons on a component by component basis...
