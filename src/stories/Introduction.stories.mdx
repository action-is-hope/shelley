# Shelley

Shelley is an _unstyled first_ UI library, meaning that it ships with a very minimal set of styles givin you complete control of your styling strategy.

That doesn't mean we don't have a base theme for you to start with, it just means that you have complete control over your styles and how they are put together. If you are a fan of CSS and like/need to control the CSS used in your project then Shelley might be for you. if this idea repulses you then maybe for for something more like Material UI which actually does have an unstyled option these days.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## How to create a basic Story for a component.

```js
import { default as MyComponentStory } from "path/to/MyComponent/MyComponent";

export default { title: "UI/My Component", component: MyComponentStory };

export const Basic = (args) => <MyComponentStory {...args} />;
MyComponent.args = { children: "hello" };
```

## Page Examples

Currently the Page Stories are a literal lift and shift from the previous Bronte Demo site. There might be a better way to accomplish this, for now this should suffice to allow us develop.

## Search Components

To pass a query to the search component you can attach it to the url like this `&query=test`
