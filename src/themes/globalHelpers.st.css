	.srOnly - Screen Reader Only 
	
	Quite often in web design we find situations where visually context can be drawn 
	form the visual context. Example: When we visually 'see' a link saying 'More information' 
	we can derive where that link might go foem the surrounding text/imagary.
	
	However, the visually impaired however will often navigate the screen by getting their screen
	reading software to collect up all the links on the page and read them out. Cool huh?
	
	When choosing link text or building webpages we need awareness and empathy when it comes
	to how others will interact with our creations. This is actually a legal requirement for
	most of us so do it! Unless you are the type of person that would refuse to install an 
	access ramp to a building. Who does that? Not us!

	Lets help you navigate the Web Content Accessibiliy Guidelines WCAG which cover this
  type of stuff. In this case we are looking at:

	"Guideline 2.4 Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content,
	and determine where they are"

	But actually more specifically than that we are looking at the 'Success Criterion'
	of 2.4.4 which states:

	"The purpose of each link can be determined from the link text alone or from the 
	link text together with its programmatically determined link context, except 
	where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general."

	- https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html
	
	FML. How many times did you have to read that? Me too! ;-) Yes, these do tend to be 
	a little wordy and walk the line on plain and simple language if you consider 
	beginners to web development and we must... The peeps over there do a great 
	job; ultimatley they are trying to make these things as exact as possible so as to
	remove ambiguity which is essential for us, browser vendors handy in a court of 
	law one would hope. Tough task, we empathise with them. 
	
	So it is exact but it cannot enguage the 'why'. Always look for the 'why', then 
	accessibility will become less of a 'tick box' excercise and more thought provoking.
	Lets have a go at rewriting it from the perspective of our glorious users!

	"When reading out the page links by themsleves I can get a good idea of where the link
	 will take me or what it will do if I select it. Unless it's something like a 
	 game of 'snap' where it would kindda of defeat the point of the game if I can see 
	 through the card. Obvs. ;-)"
	
	Put yourself in the position of that screen reader user... Do you really want 
	to piss yourself off but forcing yourself through needless hoops? Nah, don't do it!
	
	This type of inclusion approach will lead to a better experiance and a superiour 
	natural SEO if you care about such things.

	So, when you are building your next 'More Info' stylee link or whatever then provide 
	more context via some visually hidden text. That is what the .srOnly class is for. 

	<Button>More Information <span className="srOnly">on writing great link text</span></Button>

	If you are integrating into a CMS they you must ensure this is actually used by your 
	content authors or you do it progrmatically where possible which might not be as 
	good but in the real world sites degrade overtime. For internal pages you could 
	determine the page title programatically perhaps:

	<Button>More Information<span className="srOnly">: How to write great link text.</span></Button>
	
	This doesn't help us for external links so we really need a new breed of clever CMS, 
	with in CMS education and decent framing of the why. Continual auditing doesn't work;
	it is admirable but unless you are educating authors you are just gonna have the same 
	issues over and over.

	Make your shizzle accessible - it's your duty as a master builder ;-)
